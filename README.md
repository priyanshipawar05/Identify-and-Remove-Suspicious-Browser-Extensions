# Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions

## 🎯 Objective:
Detect and remove potentially harmful or unused browser extensions a to improve security and performance.

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
You can use any browser for this task . I have used :
- Google Chrome
- Opera Browser

## 🔍 Steps Taken:
1. Open extension managers on the browser:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Opera: `opera://extensions/`
2. Review all installed extensions manually.
3. Check permissions, descriptions, publishers, and reviews.

## 📋 Extensions Found:

### Chrome:
- **Google Docs Offline** — Verified as safe and used.

### Opera:
- **Opera Ad Blocker** — Built-in, helps block ads and trackers.
- **Opera Wallet** — Crypto wallet by Opera; kept for now as it's safe but not in active use.

## ❌ Suspicious Extensions Removed:
- **None found**
- (Optional: If I choose to remove Opera Wallet later due to no use, I will update accordingly.)

## 📈 Observations:
- Browsers are performing well.
- No signs of malicious or unwanted activity.
- Opera Wallet might be removed later if found unnecessary.

## 🔍 Research: How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users
Malicious browser extensions may appear useful or harmless but can pose serious security and privacy threats. Here's how they can harm users:

- Data Theft: Some extensions can log keystrokes, capture screenshots, or access cookies to steal credentials and personal data.

- Tracking & Profiling: They may monitor user behavior and browsing history to build user profiles and sell them to third parties.

- Ad Injection: Inject unwanted ads or redirect traffic to malicious websites.

- Phishing: Replace legitimate links or forms with fake ones to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card details.

- Browser Hijacking: Alter search engine settings, homepage, or new tab behavior to redirect users to malicious or spammy sites.

- Resource Abuse: Use your browser to mine cryptocurrency or participate in botnets, which slows down system performance.

Even legitimate-looking extensions can turn malicious if the developer sells the extension to an attacker or if it’s updated with malicious code later.

## ✅ Conclusion
After thoroughly reviewing all installed browser extensions(across Chrome and Opera) , I confirmed that my system is free from any suspicious or harmful extensions. The only extensions found were:

- Google Docs Offline – Used regularly and safe.
- Opera Ad Blocker – Built-in and beneficial for blocking intrusive ads.
- Opera Wallet – Official extension, currently not in use but verified as safe.

This task helped me understand the potential risks posed by malicious browser extensions and reinforced the importance of regularly auditing them. Although no removal was necessary this time, I now know how to spot red flags such as excessive permissions, unknown publishers, or suspicious behavior.

## 📚 Learnings:
- Reviewing extensions is important for security.
- Some extensions, while legit, may not be needed if unused.
- Malicious extensions can:
  - Steal passwords and data
  - Inject harmful scripts
  - Slow down browser performance
  - Track browsing behavior
